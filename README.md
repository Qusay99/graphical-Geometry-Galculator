This module respectively web application is a part of a project that aims at providing useful packages/modules on [deno](https://deno.land/). After I programmed and released a module that is able to calculate the perimeter, surface or even the volume of certain geometric shapes, I decided to create a graphical interface for the module. Which looks as on the screenshot below:

As you can see on the navbar of the web application, I am working on extending the web application to make it able to be (eingesetzt) for many topics such as physic, cryptography and more.
